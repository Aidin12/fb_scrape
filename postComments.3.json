In less than 5 months, our government has successfully divided the country into \"obedient mask wearers”, and \"selfish people who refuse to wear masks.”  In less than 5 months, our government has dictated which events are acceptable and we are allowed to attend, and which are not allowed. Violent riots are acceptable and encouraged, while family gatherings and celebrations are not allowed. Standing in a graduation line is a \"safety hazard,” but lining up at big-box stores is not.  In less than 5 months, our government succeeded in  closing family-owned businesses, while enriching large corporations it has vested interests in.  In less than 5 months, our government persuaded the people to believe that a cashless society is a good thing—in the name of a government-sponsored virus.  In less than 5 months, our government closed down schools, and permanently  \"restructured\" education moving forward—under the guise of “public safety.”  In less than 5 months, our government demonstrated how easily fearful people assimilate to lifestyle restrictions that have NO scientific premise. Our government has instilled fear as the ruling principle in the majority of the population in the UK. But the citizens are not afraid of the people in power, who are responsible for the removal of their freedoms and livelihoods. Instead, they are fearful of their neighbors, family, human contact, and the air they breathe. Our government manufactured hysteria.  In less than 5 months, our government reduced a free people into slaves to the very system that oppresses them. People who are wearing masks \"for the greater good”, will be the first to sign up for the new vaccine which will have zero longitudinal safety tests. What's more disturbing, is this vaccine will be used by our government as the standard deciding factor in our lives moving forward. Do you still think “It’s just a mask”? Wait until you are told that you cannot enter a store without proof of having the Covid-19 vaccine. Wait until you cannot go out into public places, travel, shop, or go to a doctor, without proof you are not a “risk” to others.  You do realize that our government has successfully dictated to us when we are allowed to be outside, where we are allowed to go, and how our children will be educated—in less than 5 months. A majority of the population follow their illegal dictates blindly, all because they are told to do so. They will also repeat this behavior with the vaccine for their government-sponsored “virus.” It was NEVER about a mask, it was always about control.","Awwwww the typically confused, clear-as-mud leadership we've come to expect from this Government 🙄🤦🏾‍♀️. Reassuring as always 🤦🏾‍♀️🙄😅😂","Such a dick head","What a plonker🤣","Just to keep the big execs happy 👍 ","Listen everyone do what makes you feel right don’t listen those idiots   Sick of tired just resigned and go ","So much miss information.
